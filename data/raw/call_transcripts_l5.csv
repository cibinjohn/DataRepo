141,"Agent: Thank you for calling Maple Bank's Student Loan Center, this is Jessica speaking. How may I assist you today? Customer: Hi Jessica, I'm graduating next month and need to understand my repayment options. Agent: Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! Let's review your loans. First, could you verify your account number and date of birth? Customer: Account ends with 5678, DOB August 12, 1998. Agent: Thank you. I'll send a verification code to your university email ending in '@state.edu'. Customer: The code is 123456. Agent: Verified. You have $32,500 in federal student loans with us. Your repayment options include: 1) Standard 10-year plan at $375/month, 2) Graduated plan starting at $200, or 3) Income-driven repayment. Which would you like to discuss? Customer: Tell me about income-driven repayment. Agent: The PAYE plan caps payments at 10% of discretionary income. Based on your expected $45,000 salary, that would be about $215/month initially. Would you like me to calculate exact numbers? Customer: Yes, please. Agent: Using your W-2 from your campus job, I estimate $217/month. After 20 years of payments, any remaining balance is forgiven. I can email the application. Customer: That would be great. When do payments start? Agent: Your grace period ends November 15th. I've scheduled a reminder call for October 15th to finalize everything. Best of luck with your career! Agent: You're very welcome, Ms. Thompson."
